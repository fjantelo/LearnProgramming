# LearnProgramming
##Introduction
The purpose of this projet is to teach you how to program. There are plenty of other resources out there:
- [codecademny](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [computer-science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
- [code school](https://www.codeschool.com/learn)
This is just another resource you can use. 

#Goal
As mentioned above, the goal of this project is to teach you some basic programming with the hopes of getting you on your way to becoming a self-sufficient programmer. This project will walk you through the basics and will introduce some computer science and design pattern along the way.

##Resources
This project will use [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) as the primary programming language and [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control as well as [github](https://github.com/). Don't worry too much about all of this. This project will walk you through what you need to do to get started.

##Format
Each lesson will be a git branch with the lesson plan and instructions documented in the README.md file which you can find in the root of every project (just like this one). At the end of the document, there the next lesson branch will be provided. This project will make plenty of use of outside resources (we're not trying to re-invent the wheel) but please feel free to make an issue if you don't think something is clear or enough to get you through the lesson.
